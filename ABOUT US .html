 Swasti started efforts through various channels for the underprivileged community from August 15, 2017 in Rehati, Sehore district under the i4we program, coordinating with programs run by vrutti.Our selected villages of Rehati cluster fall under 2 blocks 1. Nasrullaganj, 2. Budhni,Swasti and Vrutti cover 25  villages, where the majority of inhabitants are marginalized or tribal farmers. Out of these 25 villages, 16 are majority tribal. The total tribal population of these villages is 11,036 families,under i4we. There are a total of 2044 families in these 25 villages, out of which 1273 families belong to SC / ST. Rehati area is considered to be a tribal dominated area of the district and due to the distance of about 80 kilometers from the district headquarters, people do not get many necessary information, facilities in a timely manner. For this reason this area was selected for the i4we program and needs to work for health, education, livelihood, unclean behavior change in this area.
